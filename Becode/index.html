            I was born in Wetteren on 10/01/1992 and grew up in Lede.
            I graduated in 2010 in Accounting-Informatics. This was my first contact with programming.
            I have been working as a funeral advisor for 4 years now.
            I describe myself as a calm, flexible and responsible person who attaches great importance to supporting and
            helping people.
            Someone who is happy when the people around me are happy.
            This may explain why I have been working in healthcare for 11 years.

        <h3>Why I want to join Becode</h3>
        <p>During the Covid pandemic, I consulted the Dela webdeveloper several times because of a problem that arose at
            the time.
            We went to search the most suitable solution together. Because of this I rediscovered the
            passion of problem solving. This in turn brought me to programming.
            What started with a search on Google became an activity in the little free time I have.
            Watching Youtube tutorials, following various developers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordy_dp/" target="_blank" title="MyInstagram">Instagram </a>, buying and reading a book, a Udemy
            course and the sololearn app.
            What also appeals to me is that I can once again help people build their future.
            The challenge is to find out the wishes of the customer and then translate them alone or
            together with a team into the design of their website.
            The constant innovation and always being kept on my toes is something that really speaks to me.
            This is the reason why I have stopped my job as a funeral advisor and want to fully focus on becoming
            a web developer.</p>
